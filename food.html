              High-grade wagyu is sought after all over the world for its rich
              marbling and buttery taste. It can sell for as much as $200 per
              pound, and a wagyu cow can be worth as much as $30,000. But why is
              wagyu so expensive? The term wagyu means
              <mark><q>Japanese cow</q></mark> and refers to four main breeds-
              Kuroge, Akage, Nihon Tankakon and Mukaku. These cows were bred for
              physical endurance. Their meat contains more intramuscular fat
              cells, with the fat distributed more evenly throughout their
              muscle than others. Wagyu is graded on how much meat can be
              yielded form the cow and the quantity of marbling, Only wagyu
              A3<mark>-</mark> can be sold. The cows are often raised by the
              breeder until 10 months old and then sold to a fattening farm.
              There they are kept in small farms and fed a mix of fibre and high
              energy concentrate made from rice, wheat and hay until the animal
              is 50% fat. The feed is expensive, which contributes to the price.
              Among the most prized wagyu is Kobe beef, as it is made
              exclusively from steers or castrated bulls. There are a lot of
              tariffs and quotas on Japanese imports so it can be difficult to
              source the beef. While wagyu grows in popularity globally, it is
              slumping in Japan. Others countries are now cross-breeding wagyu
              with their domestic breeds, which means in the future there could
              be a lot more meat around and the cost could come down. Check out
              the video from Business Insider which explains why wagyu is so
              expensive:
